Ever since I was kid, I have loved coding. It all started when I was introduced to my 1st python book. I can still remember flipping through the pages and doing the exercises. Throughout high school, I have learned a variety new programming languages.  

What started as merely curiosity became a lifelong passion. Just being able to think, build, and test any idea that I had has been a blast. Sculpting data and building projects filled my life with satisfaction. 

When I'm not in class or doing school work, I'm working on datasets, projects, reading books, and collaborating with other people.
